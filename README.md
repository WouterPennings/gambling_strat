# Gambling Strat

The origin from this algorithm came when I thought I came up with a strategy where you will always win money with **any** gambling game.

> **Note**: I do not think that gambling is a good idea, and this program kind of proved it.

## Strategy

The idea of the strategy is very simple, and it can be used with basicly every game (At least, I think so, I have never gambled.)

This is the idea: Everytime you lose, you put the amount of money; That means **if** you win all the loses from previous games will be returned.

### Results

It does work, but there is a huge caveatt. Sometimes you just keep losing and since this your loses basicly grow exponentionally. In some of my runs I got a loss that was about a trillion times larger than the entire world economy. There is no way you will convince your husband that is a good investment.

## How to run

This is how to run the Loop version of the program.

1. Download version build 185 from [this website](downloads.looplang.org).
2. Navigate to the folder ``loop/``
3. Run the command: ``loop.exe main.loop``
